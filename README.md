# Spring Project

## Introduction
This project will demonstrate the skills required to create a basic application with CRUD functionality.  
I opted to create a simple system, which would allow a user to add gym related gear to a database

## The demonstrated skills

Project Management - Use of a Jira board to manage the tasks that needed to be complete.  
* **Version Control System:** Github, easier to work with and user friendly.

* **Database:** I used mySQL, which updates at midnight, something I found out in a way I didn't want to.

* **Java SE and Spring Boot:** created application in Java and used Springboot to bring it to life.

* **Testing:** Tried to get at least 80% test coverage using Junit and MockMVC.

* **Front-end development:** Visual Studio Code, with a javascript that worked as an API and a CSS to make it look nice.
