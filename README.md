# Spring Project

## Introduction
This project will demonstrate the skills required to create a basic application with CRUD functionality.  
I opted to create a simple system, which would allow a user to add gym related gear to a database

## The demonstrated skills

Project Management - Use of a Jira board to manage the tasks that needed to be complete.  
VCS - Use of Git to save the code.  
Databases - Use of SQL to persist the data, and H2 for testing.
Java & Springboot - To create the relevant code
Mockito and JUnit - To test the methods in our code
HTML, JS and CSS - To create the front end for the application.


## What you will need pre installed.  
Java
SQL
Visual studio Code
Maven

## Running the project
- Run SQL schema to create the database.  
- Change the application prod properties to match the database
- Launch the application in Java and go live on VSC


## Running the tests

Tests can be run in the file, following the test/java directory. these test whether or not the instructions work as intended.
